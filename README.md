This repository includes the global soil survey (GSS) data and files that:

* create a map of the GSS locations
* check the fit of various probability distributions to the data
* create tables and figures used in the GSS article
* produce the PDF "A survey of soil nutrient analyses from turfgrass sites in Asia, Europe, and North America" in the `/paper` directory

For an introduction to this project and the first report we wrote about this, see our [2014 gss report](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2014_gss_report/)
